# backlog

> Simple desktop app for storing TODOs, ideas or backlog items. 
> You can organize them with boards. No dependencies, no internet connection required, 
> no external accounts. Sleek flow.

### Why ?
While programming I often have number of ideas with some improvements to implement
in the future. Or thoughts about cool new project which I should start. Most often it's one sentence, 
couple words, to get back to it in the future. 

I know, there are hundreds of *todo list managers* or other *notes manager*,
but this one will eventually fulfill my needs perfectly. 
I write my thoughts on some sticky notes, I tried Evernote, Simplenote... 
They are fine, but all of them was either bloated with unnecessary features or lack of desired "flow" - 
when I open program I want type down thoughts, hit enter, and get back to my actual work.  
No dependencies, no internet connection required, no external accounts, no long descriptions.

### Demo
Just take a look on that wonderful app preview:

Downloadable links - later on.

### How ?
It's builded with `Electron` and `Vue.js`. Component framework is `iView`

#### Build Setup
You can build it yourself instead of downloading executable:

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
npm run dev

# build electron application for production
npm run build


# lint all JS/Vue component files in `src/`
npm run lint

```
