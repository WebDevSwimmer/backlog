### Why ?
While programming I often have number of ideas related to possible improvements to implement
in the future. Or thoughts about cool new project which I should start. Most often it's one sentence or 
couple of words - just a draft of idea to expand in the future. 

I know, there are hundreds of *todo list managers* or other *notes manager*,
but this one will eventually fulfill my needs perfectly. 
I write my thoughts on some sticky notes, I tried Evernote, Simplenote... 
They are fine, but all of them was either bloated with unnecessary features or lack of desired "flow" - 
when I open program I want type down thoughts, hit enter, and get back to my actual work.  
No dependencies, no internet connection required, no external accounts etc.
