### Why ?
When programming I often have a number of ideas related to possible improvements for the future or a cool new project. Most often, it's just one sentence or a couple of words - just a draft of an idea to expand in the future. 

I know that, there are hundreds of *todo list managers* or other *notes manager*,
but this one will finally perfectly fulfill my needs. So far I wrote my thoughts on sticky notes, I tried Evernote, Simplenote... 
They are fine, but all of them were either bloated with unnecessary features or lacked the desired "flow" - 
when I open a program I want type down thoughts, hit enter, and get back to my actual work. That's how I write Backlog. No dependencies, no internet connection required, no external accounts etc.


### How ?
It's builded with `Electron` and `Vue.js`. Component framework is `iView`

#### Build Setup
You can build it yourself instead of downloading executable:

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
npm run dev

# build electron application for production
npm run build


# lint all JS/Vue component files in `src/`
npm run lint

```
